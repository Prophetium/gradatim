Josephus
Alrescha
Awww... Who's that? You really frightened me.
I was just about to ask the same.
Oh, dear Alrescha... My bad. I'm Josephus, a student of Aloysius the Maestro. The same as you did.
...
Nice to meet you.
Glad to hear that the Maestro's doing well.
Not really, to be honest. The Maestro seems to have got into a nuisance.
The reconstruction of our Land isn't done by artists, but they're obviously trying to do something.
I don't know exactly either, but the Maestro requests that I come to find you dispersed musicians.
Wait, wait, wait... Reconstruction?
The Natural Disaster -- you don't know that?
Not even a demisemihemidemisemiquaver.
I woke up in this mystical cave and had no idea what happened.
Maybe that's why -- you managed to get about even before you realize what you've undergone.
...
Hopping around indeed is kinda cakewalk for me...
Really, you shall help us find the other musicians!
They're all in this forest, but some of them are brought to precipitous places by the Disaster.
...
Too much information for me.
I shall try anyways. I miss them.
Aloysius the Maestro believes in you. I know there's a reason.
Thanks, for taking me into account as a 'musician'.
You're irreplaceable.
